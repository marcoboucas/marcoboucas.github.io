    "p1": "I am a dynamic and enthusiastic Master year student at @CentraleSupélec, one of France top Engineering Schools. Since I am 10-year old, I learned how to create websites for fun! And nowadays, <strong>I am now focusing on Artificial Intelligence, passionate by this new domain of computer science, especially when applied to text analysis.</strong>",
    "p2": "Selected among the most talented tech-focused students, I joined the @ParisDigitalLab, a program of excellence designed to meet organisations' digital needs. Thanks to its \"learning by doing\" pedagogy, I intend to develop a better understanding of new technologies and the issues they raise and tackle."
